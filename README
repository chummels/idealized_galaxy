Project with Yuguang

He has MOSFIRE data from a ton of different absorber systems plotted in 
radial velocity vs impact parameter.  These are nominally for M_star ~ 1e10
(i.e. L* systems) at z~2.  They plot Lyman alpha column density as a contour 
plot and show a bunch of interesting features, particularly at the 1 Mpc 
impact parameter distance, but they are having a hard time understanding 
the signal.  

I proposed making a code that would create a similar plot from two-dimensional
distributions of matter.  By using simple models, like a ring of inflowing Ly-a
at X distance, we could see what the equivalent plot that he generated looks 
like.  That would inform us as to what is going on in the bulk signal and if
the characteristics are most consistent with all inflowing material, all 
outflowing material, or what.

I created a series of ICs with varying conditions.  All of them are a 10x10x10
Mpc box centered on the origin (where the galaxy sits).  I vary the density of
the gas throughout this box, the velocity of the gas with respect to the center
and create phase plots to represent the plot that Yuguang produces from his
data: impact parameter vs v_los.

W = inflow velocity of IGM in km/s
X = outflow velocity of CGM in km/s
Y = size of halo in kpc
Z = weighting of halo's NFW density over the background IGM at r_vir


Radial Velocity Code is to be run on a number of FIRE outputs around z=2.1 
to make radial profiles of the radial velocity going out to 4 r_vir.  It can 
be run on a number of outputs by creating a filelist.txt where each line of the
filelist is the full path of a FIRE snapshot.

python radial_velocity1.py filelist.txt
python radial_velocity2.py filelist.txt

It will generate a median_file.h5 which contains two arrays: 
--radius array in units of r_vir
--radial_velocity array in units of km/s

The radial velocity array contains three columns:
--median value of radial velocity
--25% value of radial velocity
--75% value of radial velocity
